# awrust

Minimal AWS emulators written in Rust.

awrust is a collection of lightweight, Docker-first AWS service emulators, starting with S3.
The goal is not perfect AWS compatibility. The goal is fast, deterministic local development.

## Philosophy

- Small, focused services
- Explicit scope per emulator
- Docker-first distribution
- MIT licensed
- Built for developers and CI, not production workloads

## Projects

- awrust-s3 (coming soon)
- awrust-sqs (planned)

## Status

Early exploration. APIs and behavior will change.
